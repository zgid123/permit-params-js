# Introduction

Simple package to permit parameters (from client for Node.js) to make it be strong parameters.

The behavior is like RoR `ActionController::Parameters`'s behavior.

## Installation

    $ npm install permit-params

## Usage

```js
import permitParams from 'permit-params';

const params = {
  name: 'Alpha',
  addresses: [
    {
      buildNumber: '0112',
      streetName: 'King Abdulaziz Road',
      city: 'Riyadh',
      postalCode: '12643',
    },
    {
      buildNumber: '0113',
      streetName: 'King Abdulaziz Road',
      postalCode: '12643',
    },
    {
      buildNumber: '0114',
      city: 'Riyadh',
      postalCode: '12643',
    },
  ],
  favoriteGames: ['Pok√©mon', 'Dragon Quest', 'Grandia', 'Fire Emblem', 'Megaman'],
  otherData: {
    firstCase: 'just a string',
    secondCase: ['array of string', null, 100],
    thirdCase: {
      test: 'test string',
    },
    fourthCase: [
      {
        test: 'test string',
      },
    ],
    fifthCase: [
      {
        test: ['test string'],
      },
    ],
    sixthCase: [
      'test string',
      {
        test: ['test string'],
      },
    ],
  },
};

const strongParams = permitParams(
  params,
  'name',
  {
    favoriteGames: [],
    addresses: ['buildNumber', 'streetName', 'city', 'postalCode'],
    otherData: [
      'firstCase',
      {
        secondCase: [],
        thirdCase: ['test'],
        fourthCase: ['test'],
        fifthCase: [{ test: [] }],
        sixthCase: [{ test: [] }],
      },
    ],
  },
);

console.log(strongParams); // will give the same object params, without element 'test string' of sixthCase
```
